Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. 
These shifts may be natural, but human activities have been the main driver. 
Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas produces greenhouse gases. 
They trap heat in the atmosphere and raise global temperatures. 
Consequences include rising sea levels, melting ice caps, more heatwaves, floods, and droughts. 
Reducing emissions, using renewable energy, and sustainable practices are key solutions.
üåç Climate Knowledge Base
1. Introduction to Climate Change

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These actions release greenhouse gases (GHGs) like carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ), methane (CH‚ÇÑ), and nitrous oxide (N‚ÇÇO), which trap heat in the atmosphere and create a ‚Äúgreenhouse effect.‚Äù
While some climate variability is natural, the rapid changes observed since the Industrial Revolution are overwhelmingly human-driven.

Key facts:

The Earth‚Äôs average surface temperature has increased by about 1.2¬∞C since the late 19th century.

The last decade (2011‚Äì2020) was the warmest on record.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) confirms that urgent action is needed to limit warming to below 1.5¬∞C.

2. Causes of Climate Change
Natural Causes

Volcanic eruptions

Ocean current shifts

Solar variations

Human Causes

Burning fossil fuels for energy and transportation.

Deforestation, which reduces CO‚ÇÇ absorption by trees.

Industrial emissions from factories and agriculture.

Livestock farming, releasing methane.

Fact: Human activities are responsible for about 100 times more CO‚ÇÇ emissions than volcanic activity each year.

3. Consequences of Climate Change
Environmental Impacts

Rising sea levels from melting glaciers and ice sheets.

Extreme weather: more frequent heatwaves, floods, hurricanes, and droughts.

Biodiversity loss: one million species are at risk of extinction.

Social & Economic Impacts

Food insecurity due to crop failures.

Water scarcity in arid regions.

Climate refugees: millions forced to migrate.

Health risks: spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria, heat-related illnesses, and respiratory issues.

4. Interconnected Systems

Climate change is not just an ‚Äúenvironmental‚Äù issue ‚Äî it touches every system humans depend on.

Energy: Rising demand for cooling increases electricity use, often from fossil fuels.

Agriculture: Droughts reduce yields, affecting global food chains.

Economy: Natural disasters cause billions in damages annually.

Equity: Poor and marginalized communities suffer the most, despite contributing the least to emissions.
